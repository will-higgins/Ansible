## Ansible Inventory to store details about Devices



---
all:
  hosts:
    home-switch1:
      ansible_host: x.x.x.x
      ansible_connection: [State the connection type]
      ansible_network_os: [the type of OS for the device]
      ansible_user: [this is the username]
      ansible_password: {this is the password]

## ansible user & password will be replaced with ansible vault as this is a better way.
